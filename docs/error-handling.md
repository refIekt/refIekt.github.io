Reflekt goes along for the ride with your application. When it encounters an error of its own it will stop running and your application *should* continue to keep running as usual.

{% include notification.html status="is-info" message="**Note**: Not yet implemented." %}

If Reflekt encounters an error then it will log it to `/reflections/error-log.txt`.
