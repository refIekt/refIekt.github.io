Lit is a command line interface for Reflekt (and others) that lets you view metadata generated by an application as it runs.

## Usage

Simply start any command with `lit`:

### Ruby

`ruby script.rb` becomes:
```
lit ruby script.rb
```

### Rails

`rails server` becomes:
```
lit rails server
```

Then run the application and watch the terminal window for Lit messages:
<pre class="code">
<span style="color:blue">ðŸ”¥ 12:50: my message (â„¹ INFO)</span>
<span style="color:green">ðŸ”¥ 12:50: my message (âœ” PASS)</span>
<span style="color:red">ðŸ”¥ 12:50: my message (â¨¯ FAIL)</span>
</pre>

## Installation

Run:
```
gem install lit-cli
```

Applications using the Lit API will install the `lit` command for you.

## Flags

Lit accepts flags to modify behaviour. They are prefixed with an `@` and added directly after the `lit` command:
```
lit @flag ruby script.rb --verbose
```

Lit flags start with an `@` instead of a `--` so that they aren't confused with flags for the command Lit is firing off.

### Status

Filter logs by status:
```
lit @status=error ruby script.rb
```

### Delay

Delay the execution of a program to make logs easier to read. The default delay is `0` seconds (no delay) but could be 1 second, for example:
```
lit @delay=1 ruby script.rb
```

## API

Instructions for integrating your application with Lit.

### Usage

At the top of your file add:
```ruby
require 'lit_cli'
include LitCLI
```

Then use the `lit()` method:
```ruby
lit "message"
```

#### Code as comments

You can use the `lit()` method in place of comments to help document your code. This:
```ruby
# Create control for method.
control = Control.new(action, 0, @@reflekt.aggregator)
action.control = control
```

Becomes this:
```ruby
lit "Create control for #{method} method"
control = Control.new(action, 0, @@reflekt.aggregator)
action.control = control
```

Now you've commented your code and your comments double as logs. The lit emoji acts as a nice sectional heading too.

You can even use the emoji `ðŸ”¥()` instead of `lit()` to call the method... cause why not? Climate change is real and we're all going to die anyway. So the final code could be:

```ruby
ðŸ”¥ "Create control for #{method} method"
control = Control.new(action, 0, @@reflekt.aggregator)
action.control = control
```

These are all just ideas and it's up to you to decide how to write code and save the future of humanity.

### Installation

In Gemfile add:
```ruby
gem 'lit-cli'
```  

In terminal run:
