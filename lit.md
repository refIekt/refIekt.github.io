Lit is a command line interface for Reflekt (and others) that lets you view metadata generated by an application as it runs.

## Usage

Simply start any command with `lit`:

### Ruby

`ruby script.rb` becomes:
```
lit ruby script.rb
```

### Rails

`rails server` becomes:
```
lit rails server
```

Then run the application and watch the terminal window for Lit messages:
<pre class="code">
<span style="color:blue">ðŸ”¥ 12:50: my message (â„¹ INFO)</span>
<span style="color:green">ðŸ”¥ 12:50: my message (âœ” PASS)</span>
<span style="color:red">ðŸ”¥ 12:50: my message (â¨¯ FAIL)</span>
</pre>

## Installation

Run:
```
gem install lit-cli
```

Applications using the Lit API will install the `lit` command for you.

## Flags

Lit accepts flags to modify behaviour. They are prefixed with an `@` and added directly after the `lit` command:
```
lit @flag ruby script.rb --verbose
```

Lit flags start with an `@` instead of a `--` so that they aren't confused with flags for the command Lit is firing off.

### Status

Filter logs by status:
```
lit @status=error ruby script.rb
```

### Delay

Logs scrolling by too fast? Introduce a bit of delay to make them easier to read. The default delay is `0` seconds and this can be changed to any positive float or integer value.

```
lit @delay=1 ruby script.rb
```

## API

Instructions for integrating your application with Lit.
